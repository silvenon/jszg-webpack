# Unpacking Webpack

For JavaScript Zagreb Meetup.

```sh
$ npm run build # create a build
$ npm run build:watch # create a build and watch for changes
$ npm run build:prod # create a production build
```

`npm run:watch` uses some weird nodemon command because I wanted webpack to refresh automatically even when you edit the config file. Itâ€™s basically `webpack --watch`.
