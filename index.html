        <dt>Unpacking Webpack <i class="octicon octicon-check"></i></dt>
        <dd>There seems to be a new build tool released every month. Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Brunch... So why should you care about Webpack? Because it's so much more than a build tool, it's a complete module bundler with less configuration required. It's extremely powerful and deserves much more attention.</dd>
        <dt>Integration tests in node.js</dt>
        <dd>Everyone is talking about how testing is important, but there is little talk about what the tests look like in a slightly bigger Node.js application. Nor is there talk about the encountered problems or possible solutions. Through this talk I would like to start a discussion about one part of the testing through integration tests in the web / API Node.js.</dd>
