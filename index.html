        <dd>There seems to be a new build tool released every month. Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Brunch... So why should you care about Webpack? Because it's so much more than a build tool, it's a complete module bundler with less configuration required. It's extremely powerful and deserves much more attention.</dd>
